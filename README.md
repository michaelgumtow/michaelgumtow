## 💼 By Day
I’m Michael Gumtow, Director of Application Development at Fox World Travel — where for over 12 years, I’ve been building and leading the development of innovative web applications that make travel easier, smarter, and more efficient for both our internal teams and our clients.

I’ve worked on everything from custom CRM systems to travel request processes, API integrations, client portals, group management tools, and tailored booking solutions — always with an eye toward improving productivity, efficiency, and user experience. In the travel tech world, I’ve navigated integrations with Apollo, Galileo, TP+, and other Travelport APIs — because sometimes code really does take you places.

As a leader, I love mentoring my team, championing continuous learning, and collaborating closely with stakeholders to find creative, impactful solutions.

## 🎓 Beyond the Office
I’m also an adjunct instructor at Fox Valley Technical College, where I teach PHP software development and systems analysis/project management. My teaching philosophy is simple: blend real-world experience with practical skills, so students walk out ready to make an impact.

In addition, I serve on the Web and Software Development Advisory Board for Moraine Park Technical College in Fond du Lac, WI, helping guide curriculum and program decisions to ensure graduates are ready for today’s tech industry.

I give back to my local community as a board member and coach for the Berlin Youth Baseball and Softball organization, and as an assistant coach for the Wisconsin Scorpions fastpitch travel ball team. When I’m not coding or coaching, you’ll usually find me behind a camera lens, focusing on wildlife, landscapes, astrophotography, and creating content that inspires curiosity for the outdoors.

- 📘 **Training Guides** → Pitching & hitting drills, fundamentals breakdowns, and printable guides for players & parents  
- 📱 **Social Media Content** → Player introduction posts, tournament highlights, and tryout flyers  
- 📢 **Community Engagement** → Flyers and visuals that boosted attendance and participation
